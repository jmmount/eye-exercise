# Eyes
## Exercise on eyes
This program uses an on mouse event to fire a function that moves a ball within a set parameter. This gives the sensation that an eye is following the movement of the cursor. This is another example oif using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM in the HTML.

## How to run this program
Simply mover the cursor around the screent to simulate the movement of an eye following the cursor.

## Future uses of this code
I think that a function like this could have a certain asthetic value in frontend web development. I would like to see if this code can be manipulated to drag items into new divs as well.
